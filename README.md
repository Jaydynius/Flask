# Flask   MY TASK MANAGEMENT WEBPAGE
here is a flask app that i created. Actually this is my first flask app.
i used flask to create a web application
this project entails : Routing where i defined several routes as you willl see
                       HTML: templates were used for my backened and frontend\
                      REQUESTS: which is used to handle incoming request such as  POST,which retrieves form data
                      URL: i used url[parameters toused to capture an integer parameter which i used  (task_id) from the URL as you will see here in my work
                      Data Management: The code manages a simple in-memory list to store task data.
                      Global Variables: I use global variables where the tasks list is declared outside of any function, making it a global variable\
                      Run the Application: My code checks if the script is being run as the main program 
N/B You MUST install flask to use this
